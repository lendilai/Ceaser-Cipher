# Caesar Cipher

## By **Nathan Ng'ethe** Version: 1.0.

## Description
Caesar cipher is a simple app that allows yu to encrypt and decrypt your secret messages. Furthermore, you get the chance to choose the key by which your message is decrypted by. The app encrypts even spaces and numbers thus your message is as secure as possible.

## Features
* Encryption - Encrypt your words using an entered key.
* Decryption - Decrypt a message by the key which it was encrypted.

## Behaviour Driven Development(BDD)
| Project should handle : | Input example :     | Output example : |
| :------------- | :------------- | :-------------         |
| Encryption of words and spaces       | Stc:Hello there, Key:2       | Jgnnq"vjgtg    |
| Decryption of words and spaces       | Stc:Ikvjwd, Key:2      | Github    |
| Exiting the application       | Exit or 3       | The user exits the program    |

## Setup instructions
